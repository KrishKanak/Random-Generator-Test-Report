Test Report for Random Date Generator
1. Introduction
Purpose: To verify the functionality, usability, performance, and compatibility of codebeautify.org's Random Date Generator.
Scope: The test encompasses various functional scenarios, error handling, load capacity, and cross-browser compatibility.
Tool Link: [Random Date Generator](https://codebeautify.org/generate-random-date.)

2. Test Methodology
Approach: Manual testing through a series of structured test cases targeting specific aspects of the tool.
Test Cases: Included are tests for basic functionality, format adherence, invalid inputs, performance with large requests, and cross-browser compatibility.
3. Test Execution Summary
A brief overview of how the test was conducted, including any deviations from the planned procedure or unexpected challenges encountered.

4. Test Cases and Results
Detail each test case and the results. Here's a structured format for presenting this:

Test Case 1: Basic Functionality Test
Objective: To Ensure the tool generates a date within the specified range.
Result: [Pass] - [The tool successfully generated 10 random dates, each within the specified range of 2020-01-01 00:00:00 to 2099-12-31 23:59:59. All dates were unique and correctly formatted, adhering to the expected format. No errors were encountered, and the tool's response was quick and accurate, confirming the functionality is working as expected.]

Test Case 2: Format Verification Test
Objective: Ensure the tool respects the selected date format.
Result: [Pass] - [The tool correctly generated dates in all the provided formats as selected, including "MM-DD-YYYY", "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss", "YYYY-DD-MM hh:mm:ss", "MM-DD-YYYY hh:mm:ss", "ISO 8601", "Year Month Date hh:mm:ss", "Year Date Month hh:mm:ss", and "Month Date Year hh:mm:ss". The generated dates matched the selected formats without any discrepancies, confirming the tool's compliance with user-selected date formatting options.]

Test Case 3: Invalid Date Range Test
Objective: Determine how the tool handles an invalid date range.
Result: [Fail] - [The tool  generated dates despite receiving an invalid date range with the start date set to "2025-01-01 00:00:00" and the end date set to "2020-01-01 23:59:59". Not only did it fail to recognize the start date being later than the end date, but it also outputted dates that did not correspond to the provided range. The generated dates were within the year 2020 to 2024, which falls before the specified start date and after the end date, further indicating incorrect processing logic. The tool should have either displayed an error message or requested correction upon detecting the invalid range, and not generated any dates.]

Test Case 4: Performance Test for Large Number of Dates
Objective: Assess tool performance with a high volume of date requests.
Result: [Fail] - [The tool starts to show performance degradation at 100,000 date requests, with a significant slowdown at 1,000,000, eventually leading to a crash at 10,000,000 requests. This behavior indicates that while the tool can handle requests in the thousands, its performance is not optimized for extremely high volumes, lacking the necessary robustness for such cases. The failure at 10,000,000 requests suggests a critical limitation in the tool's current implementation.]

Test Case 5: Compatibility Test
Objective: Verify consistent functionality across different browsers.
Result: [Pass/Fail] - [Brief note on the outcome]
